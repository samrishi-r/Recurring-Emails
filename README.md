# Recurring Emails

# This app is used to send recurring emails based on the schedule selected by the user.
# The user can ad recurring mails through recurring schedule(20 seconds) and weekly schedule(1 week).
# I have used handler, runnable, and intent to accomplish that.

# Iam just a first year student. So I can't complete a fea tasks and I have mentioned them below..
# In this app I have also tried to add Google Sign In, but I can't complete it within the given time.
# I have tried to make the app run in the background using a separate java class and service class. But I can't get information to that class using intent. So I couldn't accomplish it.
# The milliseconds of monthly and yearly are too large. So I can't accomplish them too.
